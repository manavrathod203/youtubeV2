1,"Hello Xander,

I will be doing the TMB in about a month and a half and I am really not sure about what kind of bag I should bring. We are doing the 10 day variant and are staying in mountain huts/refugio's only so there is no need to bring any camping gear. What volume of backpack would you recommend?"
2,Hi! Did you take your backpack as a carry on in the airplane or did you have to check the bag? I intend on taking an Osprey 35 liter and I fear they won't let me take it in the cabin although I paid a large cabin bag (56cm x 45cm x 25cm).

5,"Ik ga toch met mijn Osprey Aether, hierin zit een frame, die vind ik toch een heel stuk comforbabeler zitten.
Wij gaan wel tent camperen.
Totaal basis gewicht zonder water zit ik nu op maximaal 9, 5 kilo."
6,"Haha shit, thats difficult. Im sorry, maybe DM them on Instagram?"
7,"I get your point, but on the TMB you will never be far away from a town with proper water supply if it might fail on you. Other hikes more in the wilderness I would totally agree"
