1,Tx mate. Keep the spirit. 🇵🇹
2,Great video!  Thanks for all the useful information.  Heading there in one month!  Appreciate the comments on the weather.  I didn't know what to expect in September.
3,"Very informative, thanks"
4,great budget set up!  well done
5,"very interesting video, thanks for the details"
6,"Great video. As a brazulian ,I intendo to do the TMB and I'm trying to watch the most I can to see what to take in order to avoid a heavy backpack. Your video was the best til now which will help me a lot to tae only the essential. Congrets!"
7,Hi Xander. Well done. Nice video and great information. It’s interesting you drank without a filter. not something you see a lot of here where I live. You gave some interesting ideas like cold soaking. Luckily I’m not a YouTuber so I’ll save a lot of weight from not taking a camera. Haha. I live in Seattle Washington USA and I guess I’m starting with your videos to plan my TMB. Thanks for sharing.
8,"With growing age, I slowly switch over to lightweight 😆 The Eventum is my first UL Rucksack after nearly 20 years of hiking and lots of backpacks. It’s just one of the best backpacks I ever had - ultra lightweight, big and roomy, very smart concept of side pockets. And robust!"
9,Really Nice video.Good One.Looking  foreward to more adventure s from your Channel. ATB Søren
10,Evgen (Liteway) makes beautiful gear and is a great guy! I own some of his items and I enjoy them all.
11,"I love your videos Xander. I have tentative plans for late Aug-early Sep. 
I am slow & will need 11 or 12 days to finish comfortably. Are there enough campgrounds for people like me?
Also I am hoping to resupply food along the way without getting off the trail. Possible?
You mentioned COLD.  What were the temps?

Were there a lot of SOLO hikers?"
12,Nice 👏👏👏
13,"Great list!  You mention it was cold at night, what month did you go?"
14,"Thank you. This is very helpful. So, you did not include water weight or food weight because you drank and ate along the route?"
15,"Thanks for the video! You said you went in September, did you encounter any snow? I’m going mid Sep and debating if crampons are worth it. My understanding is the snow from last year should be pretty much melted but I’m worried about snow falling before/during my trip especially on the steeper slopes like Fenetre d’Arpette."
16,"Good video, shows that you don't need to buy the overpriced gear.. Do you know which model of socks you used as Decathlon has so many models.. Is the Decathlon rain jacket any good?.."
17,"What comfort level temperature was the sleeping bag you used and what R value was your pad? I have a 20f (-6c) comfort rated quit and a pad with R value = 3.5 or so, but I think I should probably get a warmer pad that's 4.5+ or so."
18,"Hope it helps, you're more than welcome! Have a great time!!!"
19,You're welcome!
20,Thanks! Yes relatively afforable!
21,You're welcome!
22,"Thats very nice to hear man!! I hope it helps, have fun out there! Going light is definelty the way to go 💪🏼"
23, @WanderwithXander  Yes. For sure.
24,"Thanks a lot for your comment! I think, high in the mountains after checking upstream, its pretty doable here. But if you want to be sure you can always use a filter ofcourse! Very nice that you will be planning your own TMB!!! Curious if you will go stoveless as well 😄 have fun!!"
25,I can only agree!!
26,Thanks! I will be heading to Peru very soon so more hikes are coming!
27, @WanderwithXander  Thats very cool.Have a great trip to Peru.
28,Thanks!
29,Me too! Such good quality and lightweight
30,"During the day the weather was very pleasant but some nights it got as cold as 0 degrees celcius or even a bit colder! I think there will be plenty of campsites, but sometimes you will need to walk a bit further or stop a bit earlier perhaps. In France its very easy since bivoucing is totally okay there ✌🏼 Also there were plenty of solists, I was one of them and had no problem socializing. Good luck and hope you have a lot of fun!!"
31,"Feel free to dm me on Instagram if you have more questions, its easier to reply there for me!"
32,I hope its helpful!
33, @WanderwithXander  yes.. Love it
34,Perfect!
35,"Thanks! I went last september, but in the beginning of the month. Maybe my other tmb video's are helpful?"
36,"Thanks for watching. When counting baseweight water and food doesn't ""count"". I guess that makes the ""base"" in baseweight haha. I did carry and eat all my own food though but found plenty of water along the way!"
37,"Aah so cool! Hope your trip will be beautiful! I would say anything between a 30 and a 45l back will be sufficient then. Maybe even 25L. Depends on how light you pack. I had a 40L if I remember well and brought the whole setup 👌🏼 My general advice is always, bring the least possible! And also try to buy a lightweight bag. The lighter your set up is, the more fun it will be!"
38,"I went in the beginning of september! No snow at all, didn't bring and need any crampons 😊 it was cold at night, but during the days still very warm! But of course, 2021 is not 2022. But I didn't meet anyone who had crampons with them"
39,"No this year it has snowed very little. At the end of April it was already completely free from snow, let's leave the crampons for the glaciers"
40," @Marcus_Aurelius.  Ah, good to know! I found  a blog post from someone saying they went in September and there was a big snowstorm a couple days after they were there, so it worried me a little."
41,"Indeed you dont! I think the rainjacket is okay, but not for heavy Rain of a longer time of rainfall. I will have to look into that, but I will get back to you!"
42,"Unfortunately I can't seem to find my decathlon-socks online. But I used a pair of running socks and a pair of hiking socks, hope this helps you a little bit!"
43,I went with a nighttrain and bus to Chamonix haha. So im afraid you will have to measure your own bag to be sure. If it fits you will probably be fine right?
44," @WanderwithXander  thanks! The advantage of travelling by train is that you don't have those kinds of issues. The bag has 60cm height, so 4cm above limit.. It's a few centimeters but I don't know if they will be very strict."
45,@joaonevessantos if its not a suitcase but foldable chances are you will get away with it!
46, @WanderwithXander  I do hope so! 🙏
47,"I have the 500g matress of decathlon. Maybe their site can give you more information about the rate,  I dont know this anymore. I would recommend a sleeping bag to be at least - 5c. Preferably a little bit more. Good luck!"
48," @WanderwithXander  The Decathlon sleeping pad was probably a big reason why you were so cold at night. I have the same one and like it, but would not use it if there's a chance of below 10°C temperatures at night. It's not insulated and you can feel the cold coming straight through from the ground."
49,"That makes a lot of sense, thanks haha!! I was not that experienced with camping as you can see but I found out then that I was not prepared for this. A few weeks ago I was hiking in - 17 in Nepal and luckely was a bit bette prepared. Thanks for watching!"
50,"I see people like you hiking on trailrun sportshoes, where other people say you'll require proper hiking bots that are fully water resistant? Im very sporty and a good runner, but never hiked more than 1 day in a row. What would you recommend? More sporty style shoe appears to me because of weight and flexibility."
51,Is it possible to get your GPX file some other way?  It looks like I need to pay for an AllTrails subscription to download it.
52,How can you eat Adventure food??? They are disgusting!!!!
53,"Yes! Weight, flexibility, freedom, possibility to run down a mountain and way more muscles involved. Just a few of the reasons why I love trailrunner shoes since I started wearing them last year. Before i wore the big heavy shoes but i will never go back. Your shoes will dry and your ankle will be strong as long as you dont lock it up! :)"
54,"Especcialy being a runner, you're ankles are probably well trained! You will have so much more fun in trailrunners. Me as a physio would suggest trying it out 😄 hope this helps!"
55,Wat super zeg! Prachtige tas volgens mij! Mijne was volgens zo'n 38-40l en beviel erg goed
56,Got it directly from them! Right now I'm cycling from Holland in the direction of Greece so cant tell you my sizes. Dont they have a size list on the site? Good luck!
57," @WanderwithXander  Dank je, jij ook veel plezier met fietsen👍"
